# The app that makes the operational side of security yours only but the heavy lifting technical side only mine (you are welcome)

When you input credentials while signing and you are not trying to use a username that already exists at first public and a private gets generated only on client. 
The private key will never be known by the server, the private key will encrypt the name and the password. 
The public key will get sent to the server together with the username, encrypted username and encrypted password, the public keys will be stored in the db for authentication, only encrypted with pgp_sym via the postgres hashed credentials.
The public key will decrypt the name and password and will create a role (user) with your credentials at the db based on a template role user.
The postgres db is using scram-sha256.
Personal schema with your_name_schema will get created on the db and together with her template tables out of which only the name value will get a value.
Your decrypted name and password will combine and create a sha-256 hash with which all values of all tables will from now on be always be encrypting when inputting and decrypting when inputting.
Worry not tho, because this is only 1 of 2 factors of the encryption of all your values, all this encryption will be encrypting already encrypted values that will be encrypted on your device only with the public key so they will be always decryptable only by the private key that will only you have that will never leave your device.
You will get logged in with your new account. Login technical specification will be below when talking more deeply about login logic.
When logged in you will get a popup that if you close you can always open again through a keys button.
The popup will remind you the specifications of the key logic and how important it now is that you never loose your private key.
Because if you do loose your private key, you will never be capable to sign back into your account and it will never be recoverable. 
Now this seems horrendous, all the other apps let you forget all your passwords all the time, but you cannot forget your password and loose your private key, that is the only way you can have true security in the application you are using, this is the only way we cannot possibly have a backdoor into your account.
The view of the keys will be hidden at first, you can display it clearly by clicking a button, but do it only when your monitor/screen is not being recorded in any way.
You will also get to copy the keys without even displaying them in the page.
The private key will get saved into your strict cookies for this page, if you have allowed it for the ease of logging in in the future, but even then you absolutely should save your private key in some secure password manager, ideally in more of them over backup devices, so you can be sure of not loosing a private key.
Someone getting your private key is not such a big deal as it might seem, because with it alone one cannot really do anything to you.
You with it alone cannot do or see anything.
You have to have access to your data to decrypt the values with the private key, and you can get to those only via the authentication into the app for which u need not only the private key, but also your password.
This is a 2-factor authentication without a phone/email, security upgrade of a 2-factor auth if you will.
But even tho one cannot do anything with your private key alone, if you suspect that someone knows it you should as fast as possible, just to be safe, sign in and generate new keys, there will be a button for this that will also on your device decrypt all your data with your private key will generate the new keys, will encrypt them with the new public key, will burn the old private key from your cookies (if u have it there), will throw the new one there (if u let it there), will send a message to the server to burn the old public key and all values encrypted with it and will replace them with the newly encrypted values on your device with the new public key that will also be saved in the db encrypted in the same way as it was before.
Now the only data decryptable by the server will be the from whom are which encrypted messages sent to whom: That is required for the server to be capable of sending the messages from one user to the other, but worry not, you already have the full anonymity of what are you sending to anyone and you can have the anonymity of to whom you are sending the encrypted messages/files/filenames by just choosing an alias nickname instead of any name which actually describes your real identity in any way.

When you login in the default mode the process of logging in will continue only if a private key is in your cookies, if you have selected the no-cookies mode, you will have to input the private key, into the input on the page with the credentials for it to on your device only encrypt the name and password so it can be sent on to the server where it will be decrypted with the public key that is saved under your name. If either there is not even a public key with the name you are trying to login with or a sign in in the postgres pool cannot happen with the decrypted credentials decrypted via the public key you will get a wrong credentials error.

The public keys will be in a postgres_schema

During sign up and login you will get a loading bar in the place of the error message so you know your new request was sent and when signed in while decrypting messages and all around your data with your key/keys loading bar

The login is so if the username === owner and there is not an owner_initial_sign_in_happened enum in postgres_schema, so the client side generating of public and a private key as it happens in the sign up happens in this case also in the login with them also getting set in the strict cookies and with the public one replacing whatever is under that name in the postgres schema public keys now

When the last message in the chat sidebar is too long, for example longer than 10 chars, do not show the entirety of it but just the first 10 for example and then ...

When opening the private key popup make the textarea selected by the user

When login and password already inputted make setting the private key to cookies relog with that private key and the credentials

fix the mistake that makes it impossible now for more than one person to be logged in at once lol, it is in the Home function , loggedIn server side handling without implementation for handling infinite users, rookie mistake
the session variables are fine, but the mutable ones cannot be only in the Home function , it is how my whole logging in works, those mutable variables that are global across the entire file must stay that way , but what I need u to change is for it to not be loggedIn but loggedInUsers so each time a new user logs in he is added to the loggedInUsers server cached array, I want you to cache these values in loggedInUsers for 24 hours so u then in the xml returning part do not do loggedIn && but loggedIn[decryptedUsername] &&

fix of the crashing when someone signs up when other are logged in

text transfer via sign with my private key and encryption with the public key of recipient and inverse decryption
    this will need the messenger component to send the public keys of users the user can chat with to the chat component and for the chat component to be doing for all messages/files/filenames/dates not just the encryptions it does for its own storage, but to also besides that encrypt it the way mentioned above with that being sent back to the messenger component with there being those arguments used in the saving in postgres_schema instead of the same way as is the other stored there
    asking for the public keys in a separate query from the one for the users, so u can also select the owner one all normally and then in a later condition send all the public keys but the owner one to the chat component only if the username === `${owner}` and to otherwise send only the owner public key

hover on bg in the sidebar (I get that when it is in phone mode it is not exactly a sidebar), probly like blue, when it is the li of the selectedUser , and fixing the light theme for MessageInput

pseudorandom profile pics for fun now before profiles

websockets encryption and decryption the same way as above with the keys

encrypting and decrypting dates too

sorting by ascending dates on the client

done till here

fix viewing pictures

frontend for texts and support for switching full us and cz langs

possibility to generate new keys and set them right away in the cookies and the new public one in the db with all data being replaced with ones encrypted with the new private key and the old ones deleted

displaying the pgp info and settings popup automatically when just singed up and for when logged in for the first time

deploy the pre-alpha when it is in this stage and have some people chat with some person there for real for pre-alpha testing

gonna use the auth and e2e encrypted chatting components of this app for different apps from the point of when I get to this point

settings option of displaying datetime_from info normally instead of in the retared american way

adding an option when generating new keys for decrypting messages with these new ones only from now on/change the encryption on all the ones that were encrypted so far and giving the recipient option to accept or refuse the reencrypted old messages and giving him an option to refuse or accept the deletion of the old public key of his friend and telling the first sender of this information

always filling the file and filename with pseudorandomly generated data that looks like it would usually when sending some, so the server owner can never know when is a file being sent or not (prepare a big space for the database, this level of anonymity giving will not be free space wise)
